# weatherart
A python script that makes art out of the current weather in a city.

# How to use:

You are first going to need an OpenWeatherMap API key (free) then put it in the self.api_key statement, then you can change the city if you want to. Then just run the python script and fill in the amount you want to be modified every interval, and then you can choose your interval. 

# Enjoy!
